# TikTunnel
 API for scraping tiktoks. Esentially a proxy
This program scrapes information from Tiktok and serves an endpoint to safely view content. 


Yet another project of mine (i start too many new ones and never finish either).

Due to TikToks invasive behaviour when it comes to privacy, I have fleed from the platform long ago. I my self have realised that I was addicted to the short dopamine rushes and the content on Tiktok. I don't wanna miss out on anything on there and after all I was happy using it. So I decided to start a harder project in Rust. 

This project is basically scraping all the content from the website and serving it to the end user to safely view it. Of course I have bigger plans (like implementing an AI based recommendation system ) but for now thats the main goal.



Todo / plans
Well first of all is actually writing the program. But neverless here are some features I want to implement in the near future. 

[ ] Ai for reccomendation
[ ] Frontend (IOS/Android/Web/Windows/Linux)
[ ] New client/session on each request.
